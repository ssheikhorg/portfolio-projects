## Automation 2FA
This project is a Python script that automates the process of logging into a website that requires two-factor authentication (2FA). The script uses the `selenium` library to interact with the website and `pyotp` to generate the 2FA code.

### Features
- Automates the login process for websites that require 2FA.
- Generates the 2FA code using the `pyotp` library.
- Supports multiple 2FA methods (e.g., TOTP, HOTP).
- Customizable to work with different websites.

### Usage
1. Install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the script: `python automation_2fa.py`
3. Replace the .env file with your own credentials.
